Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - 
from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.



function centuryFromYear(year) {
if(year%100==0){
return year/100;
}
else{
return Math.floor(year/100 + 1);
}
}

function centuryFromYear(year) {
    return Math.ceil(year / 100)
}
console.log(centuryFromYear(2100);

//Math.ceil will raise  anumber to the nearest number
