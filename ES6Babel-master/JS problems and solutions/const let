Given the following ES6 script:
const run = true;
let name = 'bob';
if (run) {
    let name = 'charley'
    console.log(name);
}
console.log(name);

what is printed to the console?


the second declaration of let inside the if 
statement is bound to the block scope of the if; therefore, 
it will not overwrite the original 'name' defined above it.
