Given the following ES6 script:
const MAX = 10;
let amount = 0;
while (amount++ < MAX) {
  let sum = amount;
}
console.log(sum);
what is printed to the console?

//error reference error

The variable 'sum' is only declared inside of the while loops block scope; 
therefore, we don't have any access to a 'sum' variable outside of it where the console log is ran.
