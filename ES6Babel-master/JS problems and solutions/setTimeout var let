Given the following ES6 script
const MAX = 5;
 
for (var i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  });
}
 
for (let i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  });
}
what will print to the console?



We'd typically use a IIFE to make the first for loop work as excepted, 
but now we can simply use let in the block scope to bind the value of i during each iteration 

//output 55555
//12345
