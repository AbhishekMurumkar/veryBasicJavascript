//function that creates an object 
//Lets say you need to build 50 employees using the same properties.
//the optimal solution is make a function 
//then create an empty object with curly braces
//then we need to populate the empty objects with properties and values.
//and pass the data as an argument

function createEmployeeObject(fName, lName, gender, age, location){
  var newObject = {};
      newObject.fName = fName;
      newObject.lName = lName;

      newObject.location = location;
