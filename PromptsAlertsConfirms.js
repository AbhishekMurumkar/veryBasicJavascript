alert("Alert box1", "Alert box2");
confirm("Confirm 1", "Confirm2");
prompt("how are you?", "I am well, thank you");


//ALERT accepts only 1 parameter
//CONFIRM accepts only 1 parameter
//PROMPT accepts 2 parameters
//parameter is a set of answers in a function that it can accept. 
//above code has 2 params for ALERT and CONFIRM functions. 2nd param does not work. JS ignores 2nd set of params
